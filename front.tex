Making decisions amongst a set of choices is a primary need of complicated goal models with multiple possible choices. Many a time, business analysts fail in selecting different sets of decisions which result in satisfying multiple stakeholders' goals with some optimal trade-offs between possibly conflicting ones. Most quantitative requirement engineering goal models support such activities by describing alternative design paths with different impact on the levels of goal satisfaction specified in the terms of measurable objective functions. This thesis proposes a framework called DEBRA, to identify different sets of optimal decisions that satisfy conflicting goals using Differential Evolution, a multi-objective optimization algorithm. The experimental study was conducted on two types of requirements engineering goal models; i* and Analytic Hierarchy Process(AHP). The work further highlights a probability based method to identify the most significant decisions and justifies that in most software models, there exists prominent decisions such that if set to their optimum value, it can lead to significant reduction in the cumulative engineering cost of the most requirement engineering goal models.
